              (0.012--0.492 g (organic weight of algae) g−1 (live weight of

              consumed efficiently determined their maximum growth rate. This
              ration, and the corresponding growth rate, both increased with
              temperature. At the end of each 3--4 week experiment, the

               the opposite trend. We reciprocally transplanted snails between
               field sites and measured shell length, width and lip thickness
               of those recaptured 12 months later. Snails transplanted to the
               sheltered site grew larger than sheltered-site residents, which
               in turn grew larger than transplants to the exposed site.
               Relative shell-lip thickness was greater in residents at the
               exposed site than at the sheltered site. Transplants from
               shelter to exposure developed relatively thicker shells than
               their controls and relatively thinner shells from exposure to
               shelter. Progeny of the two populations were reared for 12
               months in a common garden experiment presenting effluent from
               crabs feeding on broken conspecifics as the treatment and fresh
               sea-water as the control. The crab-effluent treatment decreased
               foraging activity, concomitantly reducing cumulative somatic
               growth and reproductive output. Juveniles receiving
               crab-effluent grew slower in shell length while developing
               relatively thicker shell lips than controls, the level of
               response being similar between lineages. F(2) progeny of the

              Jennifer C and Melzner, Frank",
  abstract = "In coastal temperate regions such as the Baltic Sea, calcifying
              bivalves dominate benthic communities playing a vital ecological
              role in maintaining biodiversity and nutrient recycling. At low
              salinities, bivalves exhibit reduced growth and calcification
              rates which is thought to result from physiological constraints
              associated with osmotic stress. Calcification demands a
              considerable amount of energy in calcifying molluscs and
              estuarine habitats provide sub-optimal conditions for
              calcification due to low concentrations of calcification
              substrates and large variations in carbonate chemistry.
              Therefore, we hypothesize that slow growth rates in estuarine
              bivalves result from increased costs of calcification, rather
              than costs associated with osmotic stress. To investigate this,
              we estimated the cost of calcification for the first time in
              benthic bivalve life stages and the relative energy allocation to
              calcification in three Mytilus populations along the Baltic
              salinity gradient. Our results indicate that calcification rates
              are significantly reduced only in 6 psu populations compared to
              11 and 16 psu populations, coinciding with ca. 2--3-fold higher
              calcification costs at low salinity and temperature. This
              suggests that reduced growth of Baltic Mytilus at low salinities
              results from increased calcification costs rather than osmotic
              stress related costs. We also reveal that shell growth (both
              calcification and shell organic production) demands 31--60\% of
              available assimilated energy from food, which is significantly
              higher than previous estimates. Energetically expensive
              calcification represents a major constraint on growth of mytilids
              in the estuarine and coastal seas where warming, acidification
              and desalination are predicted over the next century.",

               of the 25 species common to both areas were more numerous in

               industries. Those that had been transferred from Wollongong
               Harbour were similar in structure after two months to those that
               had developed entirely in Port Kembla Harbour. Conversely, the
               communities transferred from Port Kembla Harbour had a similar
               structure to those that had developed only in Wollongong
               Harbour. Many of the species transferred from Wollongong Harbour
               were thought to have been killed by periodic high concentrations
               of pollutants or overgrown by more competitive species. Those
               few that survived the polluted conditions were mainly bryozoans
               and serpulids. Surprisingly, many supposedly pollution-tolerant
               species transferred from Port Kembla Harbour did not survive in
               Wollongong Harbour. It is suggested that this was because these
               animals could not tolerate the lower nutrient conditions in the
               latter area. Space once occupied by these species was quickly
               colonised by species found only in Wollongong Harbour. These
               results have important implications for the functioning of these

  abstract = "The distribution of mussel beds in the Wadden Sea of
              Schleswig-Holstein was mapped by aerial surveys from 1989 to
              1991. The number of mussel beds decreased from 94 in 1989 to 49
              in 1990, as a result of severe storms in early 1990. Thereafter
              only small changes were observed. The mussel beds that remained
              in 1990 were found only in the shelter of islands; all beds in
              exposed areas had disappeared between the surveys of 1989 and
              1990, leaving large areas without mussel beds. Storms are thus
              identified as a major factor limiting the distribution of mussel
              beds to the sheltered parts of the Wadden Sea. Beds in the
              exposed parts of the Wadden Sea are highly dynamic, whereas beds
              in sheltered areas may persist over long times. A comparison with
              distribution patterns of older surveys (from 1937, 1968 and 1978)
              revealed great similarities with the results of recent
              investigations, indicating a constant distribution pattern over a
              long period. The results are discussed in relation to
              eutrophication and the structure of the benthic communities of
              the Wadden Sea. It is concluded that any eutrophication-induced
              increase of the mussel population would be restricted to the
              sheltered parts of the Wadden Sea. Storms will largely determine
              whether the communities of a given area have to compete with
              mussels, which are most important filter feeders of the
              ecosystem. As competition for food is a major factor structuring
              the benthic communities of the Wadden Sea, it is assumed that
              storms indirectly affect all other communities, giving
              deeper-burying, storm-tolerant species a competitive advantage in
              exposed areas where epibenthic mussels are excluded. The impact
              of mussel fisheries will be different for persisting and dynamic
              beds: fishing on persisting beds in sheltered areas may remove
              the crucial reserve which mussel-feeding birds such as eiders or
              oystercatchers need in times of low mussel populations.",

               shallow-water mussels were heavier (dry weight = 0.004L2.297)

               0.0002L1.726 and 2.5 $\pm$ 1.1 mg cm?3), primarily because of a
               nearly twofold greater carbohydrate store. In the shallow zone,
               females contained more carbohydrates (on average 5.8\% dry
               weight) than males (3.8\% dry weight) because females conserve
               energy for reproduction. Differences in physiologic variables,
               and subsequently physiologic performance of the mussels, were
               related to different nutritional conditions in the ambient

               total particulate matter (TPM) 4.3 mg L?1 and particulate
               organic matter (POM) 1.1\% of TPM as compared with the shallow

               1.5\%. The eutrophication of the Gulf of Gda?sk has led to an
               increase in the food availability in the water column, which
               allowed efficient colonization of the deep zone by the mussels;
               however, the dominance of males over females (~3 : 1) suggests
               that the food sustains only spawning-related metabolic demands
               and is not sufficient for energy conservation in this zone.

               decrease has a negative effect on calcification in hermatypic
               corals and other calcifying organisms. We report the results of
               three laboratory experiments designed specifically to separate
               the effects of the different carbonate chemistry parameters (pH,
               CO3-2, CO2 [aq], total alkalinity [AT], and total inorganic
               carbon [CT]) on the calcification, photosynthesis, and
               respiration of the hermatypic coral Acropora eurystoma. The
               carbonate system was varied to change pH (7.9-8.5), without
               changing CT; CT was changed keeping the pH constant, and CT was
               changed keeping the pCO2 constant. In all of these experiments,
               calcification (both light and dark) was positively correlated
               with CO3-2 concentration, suggesting that the corals are not
               sensitive to pH or CT but to the CO3-2 concentration. A decrease
               of ~30\% in the CO3-2 concentration (which is equivalent to a
               decrease of about 0.2 pH units in seawater) caused a
               calcification decrease of about 50\%. These results suggest that
               calcification in today's ocean (pCO2 = 370 ppm) is lower by
               ~20\% compared with preindustrial time (pCO2 = 280 ppm). An
               additional decrease of ~35\% is expected if atmospheric CO2
               concentration doubles (pCO2 = 560 ppm). In all of these
               experiments, photosynthesis and respiration did not show any
               significant response to changes in the carbonate chemistry of
               seawater. Based on this observation, we propose a mechanism by
               which the photosynthesis of symbionts is enhanced by coral
               calcification at high pH when CO2(aq) is low. Overall it seems
               that photosynthesis and calcification support each other mainly
               through internal pH regulation, which provides CO3-2 ions for
               calcification and CO2(aq) for photosynthesis.",

               seawater is supersaturated with respect to aragonite. Recent
               reports, however, suggest that it could play a major role in the
               evolution and biogeography of recent corals. We investigated the
               calcification rates of five colonies of the zooxanthellate coral
               Stylophora pistillata in synthetic seawater using the alkalinity
               anomaly technique. Changes in aragonite saturation from 98\% to
               585\% were obtained by manipulating the calcium concentration.
               The results show a nonlinear increase in calcification rate as a
               function of aragonite saturation level. Calcification increases
               nearly 3-fold when aragonite saturation increases from 98\% to
               390\%, i.e., close to the typical present saturation state of
               tropical seawater. There is no further increase of calcification
               at saturation values above this threshold. Preliminary data
               suggest that another coral species, Acropora sp., displays a
               similar behaviour. These experimental results suggest: (1) that
               the rate of calcification does not change significantly within
               the range of saturation levels corresponding to the last
               glacial-interglacial cycle, and (2) that it may decrease
               significantly in the future as a result of the decrease in the
               saturation level due to anthropogenic release of CO2 into the
               atmosphere. Experimental studies that control environmental

               variability is encountered already today. Kiel Fjord (Western
               Baltic Sea) is a brackish (12-20 g kg(-1) ) and CO2 enriched
               habitat, but the blue mussel Mytilus edulis dominates the
               benthic community. In a coupled field and laboratory study we
               examined the annual pCO2 variability in this habitat and the
               combined effects of elevated pCO2 and food availability on
               juvenile M. edulis growth and calcification. In the laboratory
               experiment, mussel growth and calcification were found to
               chiefly depend on food supply, with only minor impacts of pCO2
               up to 3350 $\mu$atm. Kiel Fjord was characterized by strong
               seasonal pCO2 variability. During summer, maximal pCO2 values of
               2500 $\mu$atm were observed at the surface and >3000 $\mu$atm at
               the bottom. However, the field growth experiment revealed seven
               times higher growth and calcification rates of M. edulis at a
               high pCO2 inner fjord field station (mean pCO2 ca. 1000
               $\mu$atm) in comparison to a low pCO2 outer fjord station (ca.
               600 $\mu$atm). In addition, mussels were able to out-compete the
               barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus at the high pCO2 site. High
               mussel productivity at the inner fjord site was enabled by
               higher particulate organic carbon concentrations. Kiel Fjord is
               highly impacted by eutrophication, which causes bottom water
               hypoxia and consequently high seawater pCO2 . At the same time,
               elevated nutrient concentrations increase the energy
               availability for filter feeding organisms such as mussels. Thus,
               M. edulis can dominate over a seemingly more acidification
               resistant species such as A. improvisus. We conclude that
               benthic stages of M. edulis tolerate high ambient pCO2 when food
               supply is abundant and that important habitat characteristics
               such as species interactions and energy availability need to be

               in which the combined effects of multiple stressors are greater
               than the sum of individual effects. Early life stages of marine
               organisms are potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated
               with global change, but identifying general patterns across
               studies, species and response variables is challenging. This
               review represents the first meta-analysis of multistressor
               studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to larvae),
               particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are
               the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic
               stressors and early life stages are also identified. The
               meta-analysis yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic
               interactions (65\% of individual tests) are more common than
               additive (17\%) or antagonistic (17\%) interactions. (2) Larvae
               are generally more vulnerable than embryos to thermal and pH
               stress. (3) Survival is more likely than sublethal responses to
               be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress. (4) Interaction
               types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and biological
               responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5) Ocean
               acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than
               noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic
               than single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still
               oversimplify complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data

               extrapolation to field conditions. Nonetheless, our results
               identify taxa with early life stages that may be particularly
               vulnerable (e.g. molluscs, echinoderms) or robust (e.g.
               arthropods, cnidarians) to abiotic stress. We provide a list of

               aspects of foraging behaviour under field conditions. When
               foraging, it moves short distances and feeds principally on
               barnacles and mussels, taking from several hours to days to
               handle each prey item. Consequently, marked snails can be
               followed daily and accurate diet histories compiled. Such
               studies reveal great variation in foraging behaviour, both
               within individuals at different times and among individuals
               during any one period of time. This variation can only be
               explained by a comprehensive account of endogenous and exogenous
               factors, requiring combined physiological, behavioural,
               ecological and genetical approaches. Dynamic programming is a

               for a significant proportion of variation in the foraging
               behaviour of N. lapillus, there remains much that is not

              first ever experiment to warm benthic assemblages to ecologically
              relevant levels in situ. Heated settlement panels were used to
              create three test conditions: ambient and 1°C and 2°C above
              ambient (predicted in the next 50 and 100 years, respectively

              consequently invasive boreal species are now able to survive the
              less extreme Arctic winter temperatures. Whilst persistence of
              intertidal and terrestrial species in the Arctic is primarily
              determined by their ability to tolerate the freezing winters, air
              temperatures in the Arctic summer can reach 36 °C in the
              intertidal, which is beyond the upper thermal limits of many
              marine species. This is normally lethal for the conspicuous
              ecosystem engineer Mytilus edulis. Transcriptomic analyses were
              undertaken on both in situ collected and experimentally warmed
              animals to understand whether M. edulis is able to tolerate these
              very high summer temperatures. Surprisingly there was no
              significant enrichment for Gene Ontology terms (GO) when
              comparing the inner and outer fjord intertidal animals with outer
              fjord subtidal (control) animals, representing animals collected
              at 27 °C, 19 °C and 3 °C respectively. This lack of
              differentiation indicated a wide acclimation ability in this
              species. Conversely, significant enrichment for processes such as
              signal transduction, cytoskeleton and cellular protein
              modification was identified in the expression profiles of the 22
              °C and 32 °C experimentally heated animals. This difference in
              gene expression between in situ collected and experimentally
              warmed animals was almost certainly due to the former being
              acclimated to a fluctuating, but predictable, temperature regime,
              which has increased their thermal tolerances. Interestingly,
              there was no evidence for enrichment of the classical cellular
              stress response in any of the animals sampled. Identification of
              a massive expansion of the HSPA12 heat shock protein 70 kDa gene
              family presented the possibility of these genes acting as
              intertidal regulators underpinning thermal resilience. This
              expansion has resulted in a modified cellular stress response, as
              an evolutionary adaptation to the rigour of the invasive
              intertidal life style. Thus, M. edulis appear to have

              potential responses that organisms can make, and how this would
              influence both the focus of investigation and conservation
              efforts. Here emphasis is given to broad scale approaches, from
              gene to ecosystem and where a better understanding of diversity
              of potential response is needed. There is a need for the
              identification of rare, key or unique genomes and physiologies
              that should be made priorities for conservation because of their
              importance to global biodiversity. The new discipline of
              conservation physiology is one aspect of the many ways in which
              organismal responses to environmental variability and change can
              be investigated, but wider approaches are needed. Environmental
              change, whether natural or human induced occurs over a very wide
              range of scales, from nanometres to global and seconds to
              millennia. The processes involved in responses also function over
              a wide range of scales, from the molecular to the ecosystem.
              Organismal responses to change should be viewed in these wider
              frameworks. Within this overall framework the rate of change of
              an environmental variable dictates which biological process will
              be most important in the success or failure of the response.
              Taking this approach allows an equation to be formulated that
              allows the likely survival of future change to be estimated:where

              Phenotypic plasticity underpins acclimatory responses by shifting
              the mean phenotype in a population, which may buffer the negative
              effects of global change. However, little is known about how
              phenotypic plasticity evolves across multiple generations. We
              tested this by reciprocally-transplanting the polychaete
              Ophryotrocha labronica between control and global change
              scenarios (ocean warming and acidification in isolation and
              combined) over five generations. By comparing the reaction norms
              of four life-history traits across generations, we show that
              juvenile developmental rate in the combined scenario was the only
              trait that changed its plastic response across generations when
              transplanted back to control conditions, and that adaptive
              plasticity was conserved in most traits, despite significant
              levels of selection and strong declines in individual fitness in
              the multi-generational exposure. We suggest the change in level

  abstract = "In recent decades, humans have become a very important force in
              the Earth system, demonstrating that emissions (gaseous, liquid,
              and solid) are the cause of many of our environmental issues.
              These emissions are responsible for major global reorganizations
              of the biogeochemical cycles. The oceans are now a net sink of
              atmospheric CO2, whereas in their preindustrial state they were a
              source; the trophic state of the coastal oceans is progressively
              moving toward increased heterotrophy; and the terrestrial realm
              is now vacillating between trophic states, whereas in
              preindustrial times it was autotrophic. In this paper, we present
              model calculations that underscore the role of human-induced
              perturbations in changing Earth's climate, specifically the role
              of anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus in controlling processes
              in the global carbon cycle since the year 1850 with projections
              to the year 2035. Our studies show that since the late 1940's
              emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus have been sequestered in the
              terrestrial living phytomass and groundwater. This
              nutrient-enhanced fertilization of terrestrial biota, coupled
              with rising atmospheric CO2 and global temperature, has induced a
              sink of anthropogenic CO2 that roughly balances the emission of
              CO2 owing to land use change. In the year 2000, for example, the
              model-calculated terrestrial biotic sink was 1730 Mtons C/year,
              while the emission of CO2 from changes in land use was 1820 Mtons
              C/year, a net flux of 90 Mtons C/year emitted to the atmosphere.
              In the global aquatic environment, enhanced terrestrial inputs of
              biotically reactive phosphorus (about 8.5 Mtons P/year) and
              inorganic nitrogen (about 54 Mtons N/year), have induced
              increased new production and burial of organic carbon in marine
              sediments, which is a small sink of anthropogenic CO2. It is
              predicted that the response of the global land reservoirs of C,
              N, and P to sustained anthropogenic perturbations will be
              maintained in the same direction of change over the range of
              projected scenarios of global population increase and temperature
              change for the next 35 years. The magnitude of change is
              significantly larger when the global temperature increase is
              maximum, especially with respect to the processes of

               model of the river system, has been coupled to MIRO-CO2, a
               complex biogeochemical model describing diatom and Phaeocystis
               blooms and carbon and nutrient cycles in the marine domain, to
               assess the dual role of changing nutrient loads and increasing
               atmospheric CO2 as drivers of air?sea CO2 exchanges in the
               Southern North Sea with a focus on the Belgian coastal zone
               (BCZ). The whole area, submitted to the influence of two main
               rivers (Seine and Scheldt), is characterized by variable diatom
               and Phaeocystis colonies blooms which impact on the trophic
               status and air?sea CO2 fluxes of the coastal ecosystem. For this
               application, the MIRO-CO2 model is implemented in a 0D multibox
               frame covering the eutrophied Eastern English Channel and
               Southern North Sea and receiving loads from the rivers Seine and
               Scheldt. Model simulations are performed for the period between
               1951 and 1998 using real forcing fields for sea surface
               temperature, wind speed and atmospheric CO2 and RIVERSTRAHLER
               simulations for river carbon and nutrient loads. Model results
               suggest that the BCZ shifted from a source of CO2 before 1970
               (low eutrophication) towards a sink during the 1970?1990 period
               when anthropogenic DIN and P loads increased, stimulating C
               fixation by autotrophs. In agreement, a shift from net annual
               heterotrophy towards autotrophy in BCZ is simulated from 1980.
               The period after 1990 is characterized by a progressive decrease
               of P loads concomitant with a decrease of primary production and
               of the CO2 sink in the BCZ. At the end of the simulation period,
               the BCZ ecosystem is again net heterotroph and acts as a source
               of CO2 to the atmosphere. R-MIRO-CO2 scenarios testing the
               relative impact of temperature, wind speed, atmospheric CO2 and
               river loads variability on the simulated air?sea CO2 fluxes
               suggest that the trend in air?sea CO2 fluxes simulated between
               1951 and 1998 in the BCZ was mainly controlled by the magnitude
               and the ratio of inorganic nutrient river loads. Quantitative
               nutrient changes control the level of primary production while
               qualitative changes modulate the relative contribution of
               diatoms and Phaeocystis to this flux and hence the sequestration

               reduction policies. Long time series spanning four decades
               (1975?2015) of nutrients, chlorophyll (Chl), and pH measurements
               in the Southern and Central North Sea were analyzed to assess
               the impact of both the warming and the de-eutrophication trends
               on Chl. The de-eutrophication process, detectable in the
               reduction of nutrient river loads to the sea, caused a decrease
               of nutrient concentrations in coastal waters under riverine
               influence. A decline in annual mean Chl was observed at 11 out

               A long time series of pH in the Southern North Sea showed an

               We propose that the observed changes in Chl (annual or seasonal)

  abstract  = "Abstract. Bivalve calcification, particularly of the early
               larval stages, is highly sensitive to the change in ocean
               carbonate chemistry resulting from atmospheric CO2 uptake.
               Earlier studies suggested that declining seawater [CO32−] and
               thereby lowered carbonate saturation affect shell production.
               However, disturbances of physiological processes such as
               acid-base regulation by adverse seawater pCO2 and pH can affect
               calcification in a secondary fashion. In order to determine the
               exact carbonate system component by which growth and
               calcification are affected it is necessary to utilize more
               complex carbonate chemistry manipulations. As single factors,
               pCO2 had no effects and [HCO3-] and pH had only limited effects
               on shell growth, while lowered [CO32−] strongly impacted
               calcification. Dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) limiting
               conditions led to strong reductions in calcification, despite
               high [CO32−], indicating that [HCO3-] rather than [CO32−] is the
               inorganic carbon source utilized for calcification by mytilid
               mussels. However, as the ratio [HCO3-] / [H+] is linearly
               correlated with [CO32−] it is not possible to differentiate
               between these under natural seawater conditions. An equivalent
               of about 80 $\mu$mol kg−1 [CO32−] is required to saturate
               inorganic carbon supply for calcification in bivalves. Below
               this threshold biomineralization rates rapidly decline. A
               comparison of literature data available for larvae and juvenile
               mussels and oysters originating from habitats differing
               substantially with respect to prevailing carbonate chemistry
               conditions revealed similar response curves. This suggests that
               the mechanisms which determine sensitivity of calcification in
               this group are highly conserved. The higher sensitivity of
               larval calcification seems to primarily result from the much
               higher relative calcification rates in early life stages. In
               order to reveal and understand the mechanisms that limit or
               facilitate adaptation to future ocean acidification, it is
               necessary to better understand the physiological processes and
               their underlying genetics that govern inorganic carbon
               assimilation for calcification.",

              considered in organismal (physiological) and ecological
              (community) contexts continues to hamper progress. Environmental
              drivers typically elicit biphasic physiological responses, where
              performance declines at levels above and below some optimum. It
              is also well understood that species exhibit highly variable
              response surfaces to these changes so that the optimum level of
              any environmental driver can vary among interacting species.
              Thus, species interactions are unlikely to go unaltered under
              environmental change. However, while these nonlinear,
              species-specific physiological relationships between environment
              and performance appear to be general, rarely are they
              incorporated into predictions of ecological tipping points.
              Instead, most ecosystem-level studies focus on varying levels of

              series of simple models based on direct physiological responses

              environment-performance relationships among primary producers and
              consumers translates into community-level effects via trophic
              interactions. These models show that even in the absence of
              direct mortality, mismatched responses resulting from often

               long-term trends on the expected number of extremes in generic
               time series, using analytical solutions and Monte Carlo
               simulations. We apply our method to study the effect of warming
               trends on heat records. We find that the number of
               record-breaking events increases approximately in proportion to
               the ratio of warming trend to short-term standard deviation.
               Short-term variability thus decreases the number of heat
               extremes, whereas a climatic warming increases it. For extremes
               exceeding a predefined threshold, the dependence on the warming

               plus cold extremes increases with any climate change, whether
               warming or cooling. We estimate that climatic warming has
               increased the number of new global-mean temperature records

  abstract  = "Abstract Climate and weather extremes are sporadically recurring
               events that may have major local or regional impacts on the
               society and the environment. These events are typically related
               to unusually high or low temperature, prolonged dry or wet
               conditions, heavy precipitation, or extreme winds. Extreme
               events are part of the overall climate and weather alongside
               average conditions and variability, and thus are not unexpected
               as such. Climate change is expected to affect not only means but
               also variability and extremes. Some inferences can be based on
               past and present observations, but analyses of especially rare
               events are hampered by the availability of long time series.
               Over time, depending on how far the on-going global warming
               takes us from the present and the past climate conditions, the
               weather and climate statistics may well come to shift in ways
               that are well outside observational data. This may lead to
               shifts in frequency, intensity and geographical distribution of
               different extremes. Indeed, projected changes in some extremes
               over the 21st century are quite robust, such as generally
               increasing warm and decreasing cold extremes. Possible changes
               in some other aspects, for example storms, remain much more
               uncertain. Science-based information both on robust findings and
               on relevant uncertainties on changing extremes can provide

              decreased with latitude, decreasing seawater temperature, and
              decreasing seawater carbonate saturation state (for CaCO3 as
              calcite ($\Omega$cal )) in all taxa. Shell mass decreased with
              latitude in molluscs and shell inorganic content decreased with

              on marine invertebrates' life histories",
  author   = "Byrne, Maria and Przeslawski, Rachel",
  abstract = "Benthic marine invertebrates live in a multistressor world where
              stressor levels are, and will continue to be, exacerbated by
              global warming and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. These
              changes are causing the oceans to warm, decrease in pH, become
              hypercapnic, and to become less saturated in carbonate minerals.
              These stressors have strong impacts on biological processes, but
              little is known about their combined effects on the development
              of marine invertebrates. Increasing temperature has a stimulatory
              effect on development, whereas hypercapnia can depress
              developmental processes. The pH, pCO2, and CaCO3 of seawater
              change simultaneously with temperature, challenging our ability
              to predict future outcomes for marine biota. The need to consider
              both warming and acidification is reflected in the recent
              increase in cross-factorial studies of the effects of these
              stressors on development of marine invertebrates. The outcomes
              and trends in these studies are synthesized here. Based on this
              compilation, significant additive or antagonistic effects of
              warming and acidification of the ocean are common (16 of 20
              species studied), and synergistic negative effects also are
              reported. Fertilization can be robust to near-future warming and
              acidification, depending on the male-female mating pair. Although
              larvae and juveniles of some species tolerate near-future levels
              of warming and acidification (+2°C/pH 7.8), projected far-future
              conditions (ca. $\geq$4°C/ $\leq$pH 7.6) are widely deleterious,
              with a reduction in the size and survival of larvae. It appears
              that larvae that calcify are sensitive both to warming and
              acidification, whereas those that do not calcify are more
              sensitive to warming. Different sensitivities of life-history
              stages and species have implications for persistence and
              community function in a changing ocean. Some species are more
              resilient than others and may be potential ``winners'' in the
              climate-change stakes. As the ocean will change more gradually
              over coming decades than in ``future shock'' perturbation
              investigations, it is likely that some species, particularly
              those with short generation times, may be able to tolerate
              near-future oceanic change through acclimatization and/or

              acidification. The results reveal decreased survival,
              calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to
              acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled
              together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among
              taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable
              trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation
              of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results
              also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but
              suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages
              is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the
              variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are
              exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting
              that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise
              caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species
              laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that
              other factors, such as nutritional status or source population,
              could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last,
              the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to
              acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated
              seawater temperature.",

              plasticity to survive in changing environments until genetic
              adaptation can be achieved. Marine calcifiers are particularly
              vulnerable to ocean acidification due to dissolution and a
              reduction in shell-building carbonate ions. Long-term experiments
              assess organisms' abilities to acclimatize or even adapt to
              environmental change. Here we present an unexpected compensatory
              response to extensive shell dissolution in a highly
              calcium-carbonate-dependent organism after long-term culture in
              predicted end-century acidification and warming conditions.
              Substantial shell dissolution with decreasing pH posed a threat
              to both a polar ( Liothyrella uva) and a temperate ( Calloria
              inconspicua) brachiopod after 7 months and 3 months exposure,
              respectively, with more extensive dissolution in the polar
              species. This impact was reflected in decreased outer primary
              layer thickness in the polar brachiopod. A compensatory response
              of increasing inner secondary layer thickness, and thereby
              producing a thicker shell, was exhibited by the polar species.
              Less extensive dissolution in the temperate brachiopod did not
              affect shell thickness. Increased temperature did not impact
              shell dissolution or thickness. Brachiopod ability to produce a
              thicker shell when extensive shell dissolution occurs suggests

              oceans at rates unparalleled in the past roughly 1 million years.
              Understanding the impacts of this rapid change in baseline
              carbonate chemistry on marine organisms needs a precise,
              mechanistic understanding of physiological responses to carbonate
              chemistry. Recent experimental work has shown shell development
              and growth in some bivalve larvae, have direct sensitivities to
              calcium carbonate saturation state that is not modulated through
              organismal acid-base chemistry. To understand different modes of
              action of OA on bivalve larvae, we experimentally tested how pH,
              PCO2, and saturation state independently affect shell growth and
              development, respiration rate, and initiation of feeding in
              Mytilus californianus embryos and larvae. We found, as documented
              in other bivalve larvae, that shell development and growth were
              affected by aragonite saturation state, and not by pH or PCO2.
              Respiration rate was elevated under very low pH (~7.4) with no
              change between pH of ~ 8.3 to ~7.8. Initiation of feeding
              appeared to be most sensitive to PCO2, and possibly minor
              response to pH under elevated PCO2. Although different components
              of physiology responded to different carbonate system variables,
              the inability to normally develop a shell due to lower saturation
              state precludes pH or PCO2 effects later in the life history.
              However, saturation state effects during early shell development
              will carry-over to later stages, where pH or PCO2 effects can
              compound OA effects on bivalve larvae. Our findings suggest OA
              may be a multi-stressor unto itself. Shell development and growth
              of the native mussel, M. californianus, was indistinguishable
              from the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis,
              collected from the southern U.S. Pacific coast, an area not
              subjected to seasonal upwelling. The concordance in responses
              suggests a fundamental OA bottleneck during development of the
              first shell material affected only by saturation state.",

               pools during seasonal variations in environmental temperature,
               we used solid-phase immunochemical analysis to quantify
               ubiquitin conjugate concentrations and relative levels of the
               stress protein hsp70. The two biochemical indices were selected
               for their cellular roles in irreversible and reversible protein
               denaturation, respectively. Proteins that are ubiquitinated are
               irreversibly damaged and are degraded by intracellular
               proteases; stress proteins act as molecular chaperones to
               re-fold thermally denatured proteins and, thus, indicate degrees
               of reversible protein damage. Comparisons involved mussels
               collected in February and August from two study sites: an
               intertidal site which subjected animals to a wide range of body
               temperatures (from approximately 10 to 35 C in summer), and a
               subtidal site where animals remained submerged throughout the
               tidal cycle. Our results show that quantities of ubiquitin
               conjugates and hsp70 were greater in gill tissue from
               summer-collected mussels than in gills of winter-collected
               specimens. Ubiquitin conjugate and hsp70 levels were also
               greater in mussels collected from an intertidal location than in
               mussels from a submerged population. Our results show that the
               high summer temperatures normally experienced in the field are
               sufficient to cause increased denaturation of cellular proteins.
               Despite increases in the concentrations of heat shock proteins
               in summer-acclimatized mussels, elevated levels of irreversibly
               denatured, i.e. ubiquitinated, proteins were still observed,

               concentrations and activities of heat shock proteins may
               contribute substantially to cellular energy demands. These

               energetic relationships of species, e.g. in the allocations of

               investigations on the work of Moore (1936; 1938a, b) and most
               have used his observation that `at the onset of maturity, growth
               of the (shell) lip ceases and instead the region near the lip
               thickens, while the lip itself becomes rounded and a series of
               rounded ``teeth'' develop on its inner side which still further
               occlude the opening'. It has been assumed that all animals
               showing these features are adult, and have ceased growing, for
               Moore goes on to say `occasional specimens are taken in which
               the presence of a second set of teeth within the marginal ones
               indicates that the original stoppage of growth was followed by a
               second slight growing period, this in turn being replaced by a
               second period of thickening and growth stoppage, but such
               specimens are too rare to be a serious source of error.' This

               Responses of the Prey, Nucella lapillus",

  abstract  = "[(1) Shore crabs attack dogwhelks by attempting to crush the
               shell. Because of differences in shell morphology, sheltered
               shore dogwhelks tend to be opened by removal of the apex and
               exposed shore dogwhelks by breaking the columella. (2) The
               proportion of successful attacks is unity for small dogwhelks
               but decreases rapidly as the shells grow and become more robust.
               The attack success rate curve begins to fall at a smaller shell
               height in sheltered than in exposed shore dogwhelks. Large adult
               sheltered shore dogwhelks are immune to attack. (3) For large
               male shore crabs preying on sheltered shore dogwhelks, prey
               value (energy yielded per unit handling time) forms a steep
               normal curve when plotted against shell height, peaking at about
               14 mm. Because of the rapidly decreasing attack success rate,
               the prey value of individuals between the optimum and about 27
               mm height is very unpredictable. (4) When presented with an
               abundance of prey in each size category in the laboratory, shore
               crabs did not specialize on the optimal size as predicted by
               optimal foraging theory. All encountered prey were attacked but
               rejected if unbroken after 0.25 to 2.75 minutes. Very small
               dogwhelks were sometimes dropped accidentally. As a result of
               these mechanical processes, optimally sized dogwhelks were the
               most frequently eaten. (5) The foraging tactics seem to be the
               most appropriate for prey types which have unpredictable prey
               values and are sparsely distributed so that encounter rates are
               always low. Most intertidal gastropods are of this type. The
               foraging tactics applied to dogwhelks contrast with those
               applied to mussels where prey value is predictable and encounter
               rates are high. (6) Exposed shore dogwhelks living in the
               virtual absence of shore crabs are much more vulnerable to
               attack than sheltered shore dogwhelks suffering high crab
               predation. Sheltered shore dogwhelks are better protected
               because of a narrower mouth which excludes the chelae of
               attacking crabs and a thicker, more robust shell. These
               attributes were even more pronounced in a sublittoral-fringe
               population of dogwhelks exposed to the more powerful edible
               crab. (7) The narrower mouth of sheltered shore dogwhelks is
               produced by a more elongated spiral growth form. This does not
               reduce the relative size of the visceral mass but it does reduce
               the relative area of the foot. (8) The thicker, more robust
               shell of sheltered shore dogwhelks results in a heavier load per
               g flesh and may represent a metabolic cost of the anti-predator
               adaptation. Such a cost is possibly unimportant because
               sublittoral-fringe dogwhelks frequently carry an extra load of
               encrusting barnacles, without any reduction in relative size of
               the visceral mass or total flesh weight. (9) Selective deaths
               caused by crab predation must occur below a shell height of
               about 27 mm. The most vulnerable stages, below about 14 mm
               height, tend to be inaccessible to crabs because of their
               propensity to remain under stones or within crevices. The habit
               of foraging on the outer surfaces of stones is acquired only by
               large dogwhelks and since many of these will be over 27 mm in
               height, only a few will likely fall prey to shore crabs.]",

               have been directed towards elucidating the determinants of
               colour variation. In the dog-whelk (Nucella lapillus (L.)) diet
               may play some part in producing the pigment for colour. However
               white and banded forms are often found in otherwise coloured
               colonies. This study describes the classification for colour and
               banding of 83,524 whelks from 444 areas around the British Isles
               and west Atlantic coast. Colour and banding were significantly
               correlated r=0.45$\pm$0.05). Because of the possible involvement
               of diet in shell colour, attention has been confined to banded
               forms. No obvious pattern in distribution could be discerned.
               Possible factors affecting the occurrence and incidence of
               banding are: climate; geology; exposure to wave action;
               predation; intra- or interspecific competition; cryptic
               genetical factors; or intraspecific recognition. The only one
               which was definitely associated with banding frequency was
               exposure (r= 0.33$\pm$0.05), but there were so many exceptions
               to the correlation (e.g. highly exposed populations which were
               entirely unhanded), that this is unlikely to be causal. The most
               probable explanation seems to be the local spread of mutant

              warming and acidifying our oceans. Current understanding of
              organism responses to this environmental phenomenon is based
              mainly on relatively short- to medium-term laboratory and field
              experiments, which cannot evaluate the potential for long-term
              acclimation and adaptation, the processes identified as most
              important to confer resistance. Here, we present data from a
              novel approach that assesses responses over a centennial
              timescale showing remarkable resilience to change in a species
              predicted to be vulnerable. Utilising museum collections allows
              the assessment of how organisms have coped with past

  abstract  = "Over the next century, elevated quantities of atmospheric CO2
               are expected to penetrate into the oceans, causing a reduction
               in pH (−0.3/−0.4 pH unit in the surface ocean) and in the
               concentration of carbonate ions (so-called ocean acidification).
               Of growing concern are the impacts that this will have on marine
               and estuarine organisms and ecosystems. Marine shelled molluscs,
               which colonized a large latitudinal gradient and can be found
               from intertidal to deep-sea habitats, are economically and
               ecologically important species providing essential ecosystem
               services including habitat structure for benthic organisms,
               water purification and a food source for other organisms. The
               effects of ocean acidification on the growth and shell
               production by juvenile and adult shelled molluscs are variable
               among species and even within the same species, precluding the
               drawing of a general picture. This is, however, not the case for
               pteropods, with all species tested so far, being negatively
               impacted by ocean acidification. The blood of shelled molluscs
               may exhibit lower pH with consequences for several physiological
               processes (e.g. respiration, excretion, etc.) and, in some
               cases, increased mortality in the long term. While fertilization
               may remain unaffected by elevated pCO2, embryonic and larval
               development will be highly sensitive with important reductions
               in size and decreased survival of larvae, increases in the
               number of abnormal larvae and an increase in the developmental
               time. There are big gaps in the current understanding of the
               biological consequences of an acidifying ocean on shelled
               molluscs. For instance, the natural variability of pH and the
               interactions of changes in the carbonate chemistry with changes
               in other environmental stressors such as increased temperature
               and changing salinity, the effects of species interactions, as
               well as the capacity of the organisms to acclimate and/or adapt

              functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse,
              particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean
              acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of
              larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical
              community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern
              Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO(2)
              concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970 ppm)
              precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals
              raised under present-day seawater conditions (380 ppm), and also
              exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae
              exposed to different CO(2) levels develop at similar rates, these
              trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an
              exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and
              drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing
              increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater
              risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to
              body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses
              derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted
              individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and
              size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase
              exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case,
              because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks,
              driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the

              carbonate shells by potentially generating an under-saturated
              carbonate environment. Resultant reduced calcification and
              growth, and subsequent dissolution of exoskeletons, would raise
              concerns over the ability of the shell to provide protection for
              the marine organism under ocean acidification and increased
              temperatures. We examined the impact of combined ocean
              acidification and temperature increase on shell formation of the
              economically important edible mussel Mytilus edulis. Shell growth
              and thickness along with a shell thickness index and shape
              analysis were determined. The ability of M. edulis to produce a
              functional protective shell after 9 months of experimental
              culture under ocean acidification and increasing temperatures
              (380, 550, 750, 1000 $\mu$atm pCO 2, and 750, 1000 $\mu$atm pCO 2
              + 2°C) was assessed. Mussel shells grown under ocean
              acidification conditions displayed significant reductions in
              shell aragonite thickness, shell thickness index, and changes to
              shell shape (750, 1000 $\mu$atm pCO 2) compared to those shells
              grown under ambient conditions (380 $\mu$atm pCO 2). Ocean
              acidification resulted in rounder, flatter mussel shells with
              thinner aragonite layers likely to be more vulnerable to fracture
              under changing environments and predation. The changes in shape
              presented here could present a compensatory mechanism to enhance
              protection against predators and changing environments under
              ocean acidification when mussels are unable to grow thicker
              shells. Here, we present the first assessment of mussel shell

               authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems.
               If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers)
               produced before doing these courses were selected, half would
               probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the
               statistical techniques employed. 2.?Some violations have little
               impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others
               increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in
               wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be
               avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are
               especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and
               policy decisions are often at stake. 3.?Here, we provide a
               protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect
               outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of
               observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in
               multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear
               modelling, and the correct type of relationships between
               dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how
               to address these problems when they arise. We also address
               misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data
               transformations. 4.?Data exploration avoids type I and type II
               errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of
               making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It

               requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously
               communicating the significance of data. In this context, working
               with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and
               interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent
               innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted
               interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful
               results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and
               which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may
               be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline
               analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data,
               the statistical models and the results, and optimize
               communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure
               and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study
               design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions,
               visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying
               dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting
               and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and
               visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step

               statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written

              temperature, salinity and food availability across 3980 km of
              coastlines. New statistical methods and multiple study systems at
              various geographical scales allowed the uncoupling of the
              developmental and genetic contributions to shell shape and made
              it possible to identify general relationships between blue mussel
              shape variation and environment that are independent of age and
              species influences. We find salinity had the strongest effect on
              the latitudinal patterns of Mytilus shape, producing shells that
              were more elongated, narrower and with more parallel dorsoventral
              margins at lower salinities. Temperature and food supply,
              however, were the main drivers of mussel shape heterogeneity. Our

              less favourable environmental conditions across the different

  abstract = "Although geographical patterns of species' sensitivity to
              environmental changes are defined by interacting multiple
              stressors, little is known about compensatory processes shaping
              regional differences in organismal vulnerability. Here, we
              examine large-scale spatial variations in biomineralization under
              heterogeneous environmental gradients of temperature, salinity
              and food availability across a 30° latitudinal range (3,334 km),
              to test whether plasticity in calcareous shell production and
              composition, from juveniles to large adults, mediates
              geographical patterns of resilience to climate change in critical
              foundation species, the mussels Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus.
              We find shell calcification decreased towards high latitude, with
              mussels producing thinner shells with a higher organic content in
              polar than temperate regions. Salinity was the best predictor of
              within-region differences in mussel shell deposition, mineral and
              organic composition. In polar, subpolar, and Baltic low-salinity
              environments, mussels produced thin shells with a thicker
              external organic layer (periostracum), and an increased
              proportion of calcite (prismatic layer, as opposed to aragonite)
              and organic matrix, providing potentially higher resistance
              against dissolution in more corrosive waters. Conversely, in
              temperate, higher salinity regimes, thicker, more calcified
              shells with a higher aragonite (nacreous layer) proportion were
              deposited, which suggests enhanced protection under increased
              predation pressure. Interacting effects of salinity and food
              availability on mussel shell composition predict the deposition
              of a thicker periostracum and organic-enriched prismatic layer
              under forecasted future environmental conditions, suggesting a
              capacity for increased protection of high-latitude populations
              from ocean acidification. These findings support
              biomineralization plasticity as a potentially advantageous
              compensatory mechanism conferring Mytilus species a protective
              capacity for quantitative and qualitative trade-offs in shell
              deposition as a response to regional alterations of abiotic and
              biotic conditions in future environments. Our work illustrates
              that compensatory mechanisms, driving plastic responses to the
              spatial structure of multiple stressors, can define geographical

              Current understanding of organismal responses to change stems

               models",
  author    = "Wood, Simon N",
  abstract  = "Summary.? Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical
               basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood
               (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing
               parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However,
               existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for
               semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative
               REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working
               linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not
               converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of
               practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error
               criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available,
               based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for
               the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly
               defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much
               more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the
               first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing
               parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an
               approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for
               efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion
               requires that Newton?Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher
               scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable
               approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is
               optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required
               obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct
               methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in
               the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in
               numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for
               prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation
               results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some
               improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or
               Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small
               number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's
               information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the
               same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information
               criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence
               failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized
               GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these
               alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive
               smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized
               additive model selection.",

  abstract  = "Gastropod shells are important antipredator structures that vary
               morphologically in response to predation risk, often increasing
               in thickness when the risk of predation is greater. Because the
               shell is composed of different microstructures that vary in
               energetic cost and strength, shell thickness may be increased in
               different ways. We tested whether the common intertidal snail
               Nucella lapillus differs in microstructure between shores with
               different predation risk, and whether any differences in
               microstructure affect shell strength. Predation risk varies with
               degree of wave exposure, so we compared shell microstructure and
               strength between snails from different exposure regimes. N.
               lapillus shells are made of a strong but energetically expensive
               crossed lamellar microstructure and a weaker but less
               energetically expensive homogeneous microstructure. Independent
               of exposure regime, the homogeneous microstructure was used to
               thicken the shell as snails increase in size. The thickness of
               the stronger crossed-lamellar microstructure changes little with
               snail size or predator risk. Whelks from wave-protected shores,
               where predation risk is high, have much thicker shells than
               conspecifics from exposed shores, where predation risk is low.
               The greater thickness is largely due to a disproportionate
               increase in the thickness of the homogeneous layer, and this
               increase translates into a much stronger shell. The advantage of
               using the weaker microstructure may lie in the fact that it is
               energetically cheaper and can be deposited more quickly,
               allowing snails to grow more rapidly to a size refuge.
               Reinforcing the shell with weaker and energetically cheaper
               materials that allow rapid growth to a size refuge may be a more
               important strategy for reducing the risk of predation than

              length seasonal/spatial variation were studied at a single site
              at Aveiro seashore (NW Portugal) between December 2005 and June
              2007. The main objective of this work is to assess if the
              ``Relative Penis Size Index'' (RPSI)--an important imposex
              assessment index--varies seasonally and spatially in the same
              sampling site and how this can affect results obtained in imposex
              monitoring programmes. Animals able to reproduce were found every
              month but a seasonal pattern in N. lapillus reproductive cycle
              was evident. Female gametogenic maturation varied seasonally and
              a decrease in capsule gland volume and condition factor occurred
              in late summer/early autumn. The gametogenesis in males did not
              show a significant seasonal variation as in females but the
              condition factor, penis length, amount of sperm and prostate
              volume also diminished in late summer/early autumn. On the other
              hand, males that were close to egg capsules clusters had larger
              penises than those far away from clusters. The temporal and
              spatial male penis length variation introduces a bias on imposex
              assessment results when using RPSI and the magnitude of the error
              involved is evaluated for different TBT pollution levels
              scenarios. We consider that RPSI provides interesting and
              complementary information that should not be excluded from
              monitoring programmes, but temporal or spatial comparisons of
              imposex should be based on other more reliable imposex indices

               facilitate their simultaneous use in geographical large scale
               effect monitoring surveys. Imposex in dogwhelks is a more
               sensitive biomarker and should be used in areas that are only
               slightly or moderately contaminated with TBT (ambient TBT
               concentrations \{\textbackslashtextless\} 2.0 ng as Sn l−1). The
               assessment of intersex intensities in periwinkle populations has
               considerable advantages in areas with higher TBT concentrations
               and should be used also wherever dogwhelks are absent
               irrespective of the TBT exposure level. The intersex index (ISI)

               discussed in light of the fact that intersex and imposex have

  abstract = "The proportion of body mass devoted to skeleton in marine
              invertebrates decreases along latitudinal gradients from large
              proportions in the tropics to small proportions in polar regions.
              A historical hypothesis-that latitudinal differences in shell
              production costs explain these trends-remains untested. Using
              field-collected specimens spanning a 79°N to 68°S latitudinal
              gradient (16,300 km), we conducted a taxonomically controlled
              evaluation of energetic costs of shell production as a proportion
              of the total energy budget in mollusks. Shell production cost was
              fairly low across latitudes at <10\% of the energy budget and
              predominately <5\% in gastropods and <4\% in bivalves. Throughout
              life, shell cost tended to be lower in tropical species and
              increased slightly toward the poles. However, shell cost also
              varied with life stage, with the greatest costs found in young
              tropical gastropods. Low shell production costs on the energy
              budget suggest that shell cost may play only a small role in
              influencing proportional skeleton size gradients across latitudes
              relative to other ecological factors, such as predation in
              present-day oceans. However, any increase in the cost of calcium
              carbonate (CaCO3) deposition, including from ocean acidification,
              may lead to a projected ~50 to 70\% increase in the proportion of
              the total energy budget required for shell production for a
              doubling of the CaCO3 deposition cost. Changes in energy budget
              allocation to shell cost would likely alter ecological trade-offs
              between calcification and other drivers, such as predation, in
              marine ecosystems.",
